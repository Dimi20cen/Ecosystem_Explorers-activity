# Ecosystem_Explorers-activity
Activity for SugarLabs




Concept:
In this game, the player would create and control a virtual organism with different traits that
affect its survival and reproduction. The player would then be able to choose which traits their
organism would possess, such as its body size and speed. Based on these attributes, each
organism would have different energy costs ( larger organisms need to eat more etc). They would
then let their creature loose in a simple environment consisting of resources/food, but also
dangers such as predators. The game would then introduce other organisms to compete with the
player’s organism with randomized traits. Based on the player’s organisms attributes, the player
would compete with other organisms for the resources. After a few minutes of gametime, the
player would get to choose which surviving organism they want to reproduce with (assuming the
player survived) and the resulting offspring would have a mixture of the parent organisms traits.
The new creature joins the environment and the game continues. The game ends when all
descendants of the original organism are dead.
I would also love to create a few different “environments” that the players can play in, that
change the strategy the player would have to follow, for example by increasing or decreasing
resource scarcity or introducing events such as “volcanic eruptions”. Would the big, fast creature
from the previous game session thrive in an environment with significantly fewer resources?
Throughout the game, the player would learn about the key concepts of natural selection, such as
adaptation, variation, and mutation. The game could also include educational resources such as
videos, short text “tips” and quizzes that provide additional information about these concepts and
help them strategize and create the most fitting organism for each environment.
This might sound complicated for young children to understand, but I plan on making it as
intuitive as possible. For example, in the volcanic eruption scenario, a sound effect of a volcano
erupting would play and the environment screen would take on a red tint. A pop up window
would appear:
“Uh-oh! A big volcano exploded and filled the area with smoke and lava! The smoke has
completely covered the sky, you can barely see the sun. This means that plants will not get
enough sunlight and will start dying soon. Maybe it would be a good idea to make sure that your
new organisms will not need as much food :) “
I wrote the above example to illustrate my point, but I plan to make the actual educational
pop-ups more fun and interactive (and a bit more information dense).
I believe this game could help children learn about some basic biological concepts in a fun way
while at the same time developing their critical thinking capabilities.
